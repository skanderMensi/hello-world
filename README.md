just another repository

Hi people!
I am Skander from Swizerland. I am mainly interested in Computational Neurosciences. During the last years I have developed new algorithms and statistical methods to understand neural computations, and I will continue to do so.
During my free time I am developing sound-related objects such as synthetiser or sound processor under the name "ArcEnCiel Electronique". To do so, I am using digital and analog electronics as well as other unusual techniques.
I am mainly working with Matlab and Python, but for other projects I am also using PureData, Arduino and Processing.
